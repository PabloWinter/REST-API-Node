## REST API

This REST API can get, post, update and delete employee records from a database. The idea is to use this back-end API to retrieve data from a front-end application and display it in a nice user interface.

## Technologies

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Server-side framework
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) - API Development environment
* MYSQL - Database 
* Node.js

## Testing

I used postman API development environment to test the http requests GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

### Running the program

Run npm command

npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json. 

```
npm install
```

Then initialize the localhost server by running the following command.

```
node public/server
```
